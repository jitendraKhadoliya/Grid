    /* grid-template-columns: 200px repeat(2,1fr); */
    /* in repeat property at first poisiton how many time we want to give poisiton 
    and at second poisiton we write the length or height */
    /* grid-template-rows: 100px 100px; */
    /* here we gave height in rows explecitly */
    /* grid-auto-flow: row; */

    /* grid-row-gap: 20px; */

    /* gap property works for both row and coloumn first for row second for coloumn */

/* grid-template-columns:repeat(3,1fr);
     here we fixed 3 columns but we can do auto-fit and auto-fill here so box take shape acording to there length and hight */


      /* grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 100px); 
    in that case box are filling well but the items are fixed with their size that we given so for resolve it we can use minmax() property here*/

        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit , minmax(150px,1fr));
    /* here we the difference between auto-fill and auto-fit in auto-fill container will not take extra space that if space is exist in the case of auto-fit variable will adopt that extra space*/



    .item1{
    /* grid-column-start: 1;
    grid-column-end:4; */

    /* more short propety */
    /* grid-column: 1 / 3;
    /* first value desides start point of item
    after forword slace sencond values decides the end point of item */ 

    /* more shorter property  */
    /* grid-column: span 2;
    span shows the start point of any item 
    where second value shows the end point of the item */ 

    /*  one more property is out there if i want to add full line then i can use*/
    /* grid-column: 1 /-1; */
    /* here -1 shows the end point means end point always stays -1 */
